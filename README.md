Virtual Lab for Web Lab Backend Development Database 

Hi all!

So, here are the tasks for this evening!

1. Find the Beer ERD document in the ERD Folder.  Create that database in your own mysql instance (either in your virtual machine, Xamp, Mamp, etc.)
2. Find some Sample Data in the Sample Data folder.  Create INSERT statements to insert this data into the database.  Find issues?  UPDATE or DELETE statements should fix it!
3. See if you can write the SELECT statements to answer the questions in the Questions folder.

I'll be on Slack all evening.  Either message me @david.edwards or post in the #database channel.
