Virtual Lab for Web Lab Backend Development Database 

Hi all!

## Tasks for 20151007 Virtual Lab
Today shouldn't take as long as Monday's!

1. Use the database we imported from class.  I know most of you renamed it to `lab-brewery`, but if you haven't, or want to start from scratch, I've included the import file in /Sample Data.
2. Try to create queries which answer the questions under https://github.com/doofusdavid/db-virtual-lab/blob/master/Questions/20151007%20Lab%202%20Questions.md
3. That's it!

## Archived tasks for 20151005 Virtual Lab
So, here are the tasks for this evening!

1. Find the Beer ERD document in the ERD Folder.  Create that database in your own mysql instance (either in your virtual machine, Xamp, Mamp, etc.)
2. Find some Sample Data in the Sample Data folder.  Create INSERT statements to insert this data into the database.  Find issues?  UPDATE or DELETE statements should fix it!  Also, note that the BeerIngredients Table in the ERD corresponds to the Recipes data in the data file.  
3. See if you can write the SELECT statements to answer the questions in the Questions folder.

I'll be on Slack all evening.  Either message me @david.edwards or post in the #database channel.
